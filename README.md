# SOLID Principles in Java

This repository demonstrates the **SOLID** principles with simple examples in Java.

## Principles Covered:
1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** - Each class has one responsibility.
2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)** - Code should be open for extension but closed for modification.
3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)** - Subtypes should be replaceable for their base types.
4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)** - Interfaces should be specific rather than general.
5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)** - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules.

### **Explanation:**  

This repository provides a simple implementation of **SOLID** principles in **Java**. SOLID consists of five design principles that help in developing **scalable, readable, and flexible** software.  

✅ **Project Features:**  
- Implementation of all five **SOLID** principles with simple and understandable examples.  
- Follows **best practices** in object-oriented design.  
- Ideal for **learning and quickly reviewing** SOLID principles.  

📌 **Why is SOLID important?**  
Applying these principles **reduces dependencies between classes, improves code maintainability, and enhances testability**.  

📖 **How to use this project?**  
Compile and run the Java code to see the output for each principle. For more details, check **README.md**.
