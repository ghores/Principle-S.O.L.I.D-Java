# SOLID Principles in Java

This repository demonstrates the **SOLID** principles with simple examples in Java.

## Principles Covered:
1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** - Each class has one responsibility.
2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)** - Code should be open for extension but closed for modification.
3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)** - Subtypes should be replaceable for their base types.
4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)** - Interfaces should be specific rather than general.
5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)** - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules.
